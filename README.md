# Fashion-throughout-the-Years
The code in this repository performs image classification by two different Convolutional Neural Network models.
The data we use is images of garments from each decade ranging from 1820 to 2020 gathered and edited initially with Bing Image Downloader and then added to and edited by us. We will not be using color in our approach and so the images will be converted to black and white before they are used for training and testing the models. Each image will be associated with a decade. The goal is for the model to be able to classify unseen images by decade. Additionally, we will use a probability prediction model to be able to visualize a breakdown of how the model has processed the unseen image and which decades have the highest probabilities. These probabilities will be used to analyze the origins of 2020 fashion trends.
